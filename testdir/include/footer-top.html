            In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and
            policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering USDA
            programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or reprisal
            or retaliation for prior civil rights activity in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA.
            <br><br>

            for benefits. Individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities may contact USDA through the
