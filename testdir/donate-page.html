          You can help a few of the thousands of needy in our community that are unable to feed their 
          families due to high unemployment and  
          the poor economy. Donate a bag of food or write a check. 
          Perhaps you have a surplus of vegetables from your garden or fruit trees that produce more than you need.
          And any donation of $1 or more to a food pantry goes a 
          long way to help the families  
          in need, as a dollar buys food for about 4 meals. Government supplied food has been cut 40% so we 
          depend more on contributions and  
          individual food drives to support our efforts. <br><br>  
 
          We buy about $ 10,000 of food each month with hundreds of coupons and bulk discounts  
          from our local stores. A dollar buys an 18 oz. peanut butter or offsets the cost of 25 pound
          sacks of rice or pinto beans. <i>Ralphs,  
          Vons and Pavilions, Smart &amp; Final, Trader Joes, Albertson's, and Sprouts</i> all support the pantry.<br><br>  

          The average client at our pantry receives  
          enough food for about 3 days worth of meals, <i id="icolor">but only once each month</i>
          as we have a very limited budget that supports about 50 clients each day,  
          5 days a week.<br><br><br>

            You can use our PayPal button for tribute donations as well. However, you should designate the person's
            name and the reason for the tribute before you <b>submit</b> the donation. The memo field for PayPal can be accessed
            on the donation <b>review page</b> (after you enter all the other information, but before you actually submit 
            the donation) as shown below:
