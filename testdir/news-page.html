          <h4>Pantry <b>MAN</b>power (a Father's Day Salute)</h4>

          <p>
            <i>(By Tedi Mae Tortolano)</i><br><br>

            The volunteer crews in the kitchen are predominately women, but men serve throughout the Pantry as well.
            We recognize these men (and highlight some of them) as our Father's Day article.<br><br>

            Starting at the beginning,  Clem Matzen in 1985 took the initiative to visit the various churches
            and temples in the community to establish an interfaith, community-supported coalition, transforming
            the Pantry from a closet at POP into the organization it is today.<br><br>

            On Senior Wednesday, a steadfast crew join Margaret Shively at her usual place behind the distribution
            table setting up and taking down the distribution area (come rain or shine).  Among them are Jerry Murphey,

            Harry Seidman, and John Willauer.  Roman Melynck directs traffic coming into and out of the parking lot.
            Paul Sylvester, a Food Pantry volunteer since its inception, assists at Food Drives and has been a food "picker upper".
            <br><br>

            Jerry Murphey, father of two sons (now 32 and 34 years old), has been a regular volunteer at the Food Pantry
            since 2004, stocking shelves and assisting on Senior Wednesdays until back surgery a few years ago
            interrupted his activity.  His pantry involvement is due to his wife of 36 years, Theresa, who volunteered
            on Food Pantry shifts for eleven years before he became involved.<br><br>

            "She was the one that helped me get started.  I'm back at the senior program and happy to be there", Jerry says.
            "Being there... makes me think about how lucky I am to be on the giving side of the line". 
            For 30 years, Jerry worked in rock 'n roll production.  After tour dates were set up, he would book hotels,
            the air and ground transportation, and then make an itinerary that detailed the daily schedule.  Following this
            he would travel to the next cities on the tour "to personally arrange all the details.  I was lucky to work
            with some great artists in the business:  Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, and Barbra Streisand are the big names
            I worked with."
            <br><br>

            Other men who volunteer rely less on physical strength than on intellectual acuity and determined commitment.
            These Food Pantry "techies" check-in each Pantry client who comes in for food. Working AM and PM shifts, keeping
            tabs on the computer are John Demmitt, Richard Karp, Natt Narhthong, and Paul Rosenbaum.  Shift Volunteers dispensing
            food are Bruce Lerner, Ed Savitz, Greg Shelton and Ed Combs (who also volunteers at the computer).<br><br>

            Publishing the Pantry Paper, newsletters, and our West Valley Food Pantry website also requires  computer technology.
            We take this opportunity to acknowledge that these resources are provided by Tim Abad,  John Demmitt, and Hank Suzukawa.
            <br><br>

            Tim Abad worked as office manager of St. Luke's Lutheran Church for eight years.  While working there he learned
            to design online newsletters with help from Pastor Bernt Hillesland who had originally designed the church's website.
            Church liaison Randy Kistler introduced Tim to the Pantry, and he is currently volunteering as Pantry Paper publisher.
            <br><br>

            Tim earned two Associates Degrees from Pierce College:  one for Social and Behavioral Studies and another for
            Science/Technology/Engineering and Mathematics (S.T.E.M.).  Tim will be attending California State University Northridge
            in the fall and is a Computer Information Technology major.  Tim is also a certified computer technician and holds
            both A+ and Network+ certifications.<br><br>

            Nearly 4,000 years ago a Babylonian youth carved the first known Father's Day card in clay wishing his father 
            good health and a long life.  Today we thank the men who help make the Pantry function. Father's Day this year
            happens to be Chris Smith, the Sexton at Prince of Peace Church, birthday.  Happy birthday, Chris!

          <h4>May 12, 2018 - Postal Food Drive</h4>

          <p>
            <i>(By Ruth Denburg Yoshiwara)</i><br><br>

            The shelves and warehouses of the West Valley Food Pantry are full to the brim because we just benefited
            from the largest one-day food drive in the nation:  the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC)
            Stamp Out Hunger National Food Drive.  Occurring on the second Saturday in May every year for the past 25 years
            (this year on May 12), the drive has delivered more than one billion pounds of food over that time.  The drive
            is led by letter carriers represented by the National Association of Letter Carriers (AFL-CIO), aided by
            rural letter carriers, other postal employees and volunteers.  Mail carriers collect non-perishable food
            donations left by mailboxes and in post offices, and deliver them to local community food banks, pantries and shelters.
            <br><br>

            Post office branches in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands participate.
            Our own benefactor was the Woodland Hills Post Office branch (zipcode 91367), located at the former Macy's
            furniture center at the Topanga Promenade.  They delivered  981 bags of groceries from 3:30 until 8:00 p.m.,
            and we continued to pick up for food from them for the following <b>TWO WEEKS</b>!  We estimate that we
            received almost 1,200 boxes of food.
            <br><br>

            On our end, Julianne Sorice recruited 292 volunteers to help with the unloading, sorting and storing of the deliveries.
            We shared our haul with the Family Rescue Center (RESCATE).
            <br><br>

            The Postal Drive is one of our two biggest projects of the year, the other coming in November, right
            before Thanksgiving.  In between, we rely on smaller donations from people and businesses, and purchase 
            food when donations are not enough.  With help from the community, and all of you WVFP volunteers, we happily
            pass on the bounty so that no one goes hungry.
            <br><br>

          <h4>Pantry Volunteers - the National Charity League</h4>

          <p>
            <i>(By Tedi Mae Tortolano)</i><br><br>

            As defined on the National Charity League website 
            <a href="https://www.nationalcharityleague.org" target="_blank">https://www.nationalcharityleague.org</a>:<br>
            <p style="position:relative;left:5%;width:80%;"><i>The National Charity League, Inc. (NCL) is a non-profit national
            organization that is committed to the 
            development of mothers and daughters as leaders and is dedicated to improving local communities through 
            hands on volunteerism.  The NCL experience inspires and empowers women to succeed as confident 
            well-rounded and socially aware contributors to society.</i></p>

            Our San Fernando chapter of NCL, lead by current President Christine Ross, continues these endeavors with 
            its affiliation with the West Valley Food Pantry. The NCL began its support in 1987 with major financial 
            funding of food and goods, various fund-raising programs, and the active participation of member volunteerism
            in all these projects. The funds
            raised through The NCL Charity Ball enable them to give the Pantry a large amount of financial support each year
            for the food and homeless program through the grant request process.<br><br>

            If you are a West Valley Food Pantry volunteer who works morning or afternoon shifts waiting on clients,
            you may have worked alongside teams of National Charity League mothers and daughters (seventh grade and above).
            These NCL teams are most evident during the holiday seasons, when the Food Pantry is busiest and the students are
            on school breaks.  By extending their knowledge above and beyond the practices of social graces, these NCL
            mother-daughter leadership training programs in community service give the girls life lessons and first-hand
            experience in the responsibilities of organizing, making arrangements, collecting toys and gift card donations,
            and setting up for their much-anticipated annual holiday toy drive and  "back-to-school" backpack drives.
            <i>"It is an impactful connection, especially when they speak to the clients and realize how warm, friendly
            and grateful they are to be receiving assistance"</i> observes Tiffany Takac, VP of Philanthropy.  <br><br>

            Terri Zaelke, mother of two daughters that went through the NCL program (Lauren Elizabeth Stengel, 30 years old,
            married last year, and Caroline Helene, 18 years old, graduating this year from Sierra Canyon) reflects:
            <i>"Years ago, before the Toy Drive existed, families used to be given one gift for each child (if available)
            when they came for food in December.  As was common, by Christmas Eve we were completely out of toys for boy teens.
            My daughter called her father to run to her room and get all of her Christmas money, then race to Target and use
            all to buy boy teen gifts.  I've never forgotten her act of generosity, one she learned on her own by the love
            she developed for supporting the Pantry."</i><br><br>

            Joanne Norris, mother of Jordan (eight grade) says:  <i>"We see the need this fills in the community.  In 
            many conversations we have had with the clients they are truly grateful for what the pantry gives them;
            they wouldn't know how to manage without the assistance of the Pantry."</i><br><br>

            <br>

            The West Valley Food Pantry is grateful to all the many NCL mother-daughter teams devoting time in volunteering
            at the Food Pantry.  Allison Gordon, the current WVFP Shift Scheduler (a daunting task) recognized the NCL shift
            teams that served most frequently during the past year. The mentioned teams were  Kristi and Maya Bala, 
            Jennifer and Madison Clark, Edith and Saree Leifer, Nikki and Kate Mead, Joanne and Jordan Norris,
            Julie and Samantha Nadler, and Bonnie and Petra Stoilkovich.  Thank you, to these and all the other 
            teams who help so much!

          <h4>Senior Wednesdays</h4>

          <p>
            <i>(By Ruth Denburg Yoshiwara)</i><br><br>

            All West Valley Food Pantry Volunteers are capable, but the Senior Wednesday morning shift may be
            the most capable of all.  On the first Wednesday morning of every month, the Pantry gets a huge influx
            of senior clients who come, not only for their weekly or monthly grocery order, but also for a special
            ten year old program for seniors offered by the Los Angeles Food Bank executed in the POP parking lot from 9 to 11 a.m.
            <br><br>

            Known as "Senior Wednesday" at the Food Pantry, but officially known as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program
            funded by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, this program distributes mostly EFAP food, with some additional items
            from the L A Food Bank. Low income qualification is not needed for this program.  Each month, seniors 
            (considered anyone over the age of 61) sign up at a table in the POP courtyard (usually manned by Pantry
            volunteer Jill Rotner) where they are given a ticket.  Then, in exchange for the ticket, each client picks up a bag
            filled with groceries from tables in the parking lot in front of the storage units (also manned by our volunteers).
            Every registered senior in the household can get a bag.<br><br>

            Participants in Senior Wednesday need not be registered as <b>Pantry</b> clients, but many of them are, and they
            come in to the Pantry for their regular food order after picking up the "Senior Wednesday" package.  The average
            number of seniors served on this one day is about 150, so you can imagine the crowd that must be processed in
            the Pantry!  For this reason, Pantry Senior Wednesday usually is assigned 6 volunteers each month.  The team
            is headed by Shift Leader Lee Tishler and manned by a crackerjack crew of "regulars" who have worked 
            together a long time.
            <br><br>

            For our seniors, the first Wednesday morning of each month is a "Senior Moment" they won't want to forget!
            <br><br>

          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>
          People Assisting the Homeless (PATH) is a non-profit that houses approximately ninety homeless
          seniors (many of them veterans) in a beautiful apartment building in the West Valley. But none of
          these seniors has transportation to and from our Pantry. Finding a way to serve this group of potential
          clients required a little thinking outside of the box (or norm anyway).<br><br>

          PATH has volunteers from the Knights of Pythias who were willing to come to the pantry once a month and
          transport food to the seniors in their personal cars. The Altar Guild of Prince of Peace volunteered to 
          be the first group to come to the Pantry and pack the month's food into packages. And nearly 60 homeless
          seniors without transportation became Pantry clients.
          <br><br>

          A big <b>Thank you</b> to the Altar Guild and the Knights of Pythias! We need volunteer teams to come once
          a month (the second Thursday) to pack these food distribution bags. If you are already a Pantry volunteer, send an
          email to <a href="mailto:wvfoodpantry@gmail.com?subject=Help%20Pack%20PATH">wvfoodpantry@gmail.com</a> to
          volunteer for a day. If you have not already filled out a volunteer application, go to our Volunteer page
          and join us.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>!WOW!</h4>

        <p>

          Each Sunday during this year's Lenten season, the always active <b>Women of Winnetka</b>,
          a group of volunteers at Saint Martin-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church, held a food drive in support
          of the West Valley Food Pantry.  This was the second Lenten Food Drive organized by the newly formed group.

          <img src="photos/May-2018/wow-01.jpg" 
                alt="WOW Food Drive" class="img-responsive" style="float:left;width:40%;padding:10px;">

          This year's drive focused on the needs of the homeless in particular, but canned goods, snacks and non-perishables
          of all kinds were donated by parishioners, then collected and delivered to the Pantry by the WOWs, as they call
          themselves. Rich Poppenberg, Saint Martin's representative on the Board of The WVFP, worked with the WOWs to help
          coordinate the drive and answer questions, but it was the amazing Women Of Winnetka who put in the time, effort
          and commitment to make things happen, and their determination to ensure that "no one goes away hungry" which made
          this drive such a success.  As always, Saint Martin's parishioners responded to this appeal by filling the bins set
          up in the parish hall.  The WOWs look forward to continuing to open their hearts to help WVFP and the community
          members they serve to truly thrive.  Special thanks to Janice Smith and Jan Francis of the WOWs, for their dedication,
          and to Ruth Mutti and Kate Varley of Saint Martin's for their assistance.

      <h5>West Valley Food Pantry Starts New Homeless Program</h5>
      <p>
        In response to the increasing number of true homeless in the West Valley, the Food Pantry 
        started a new and expanded program at our Prince of Peace site on April 3, 2017. 
        Previously, homeless without resources to cook or refrigerate food have been furnished enough 
        food for one day (plus extras) weekly.  These homeless will now be able to receive enough food 
        for three days (per person) weekly!  This new policy entails additional food purchases for Food Pantry, 
        since the size of the cans or containers used is smaller than those normally received through donations,
        and they must have "pop-top" lids.
        <br><br>

        (A homeless person is defined as one who has no regular abode or shelter or who sleeps in their car. 
        They have no way to cook or refrigerate their food. They declare the intention of staying in our 
        regular West Valley area for a short period (desired, but not required).  They also "self-certify" that 
        they are low-income (rather an obvious declaration).) 
        <br><br>

        About 45 homeless "families" depend on our Pantry each week - an increase of 50% over last year. 
        The Pantry has established a separate fund to cover the cost of the new program.  Presently we have enough money 
        for a year forward!  We are receiving help from Trader Joes and Sprouts as well, and we are very thankful 
        for their role. We also receive bread and bakery goods from other markets in the valley. The program is 
        now running at our Prince of Peace site and is expected to be extended to our FRC site (Canoga Park Presbyterian)
        by July 1, 2017

      The National Charity League is sponsoring the back-to-school program this year. 
      We are purchasing around 200 backpacks to fill with supplies. We are looking for a sponsor 
      for the backpack purchase (one is already providing 100 backpacks). If you are interested or 
      know anyone who might be, please direct them to Susan Steeb (wvfoodpantry@gmail.com)
      or Debbie Decker (foodpantry@popwh.org).<br><br>

      The backpacks and supplies will be distributed Saturday, August 8th from 10 am to noon. West Valley
      Food Pantry clients who desire backpacks must be active clients with the pantry and must sign up prior to the event.
      <br><br>
