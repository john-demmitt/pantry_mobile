            <h4 style="text-align:center;">We always need more volunteers!</h4>

            <p>Volunteers typically work at the Pantry in two-and-a-half hour shifts, 
               Monday through Thursday, and one shift on Friday. Volunteers may schedule to work shifts once a week, 
               or once a month or more, depending upon interest and availability.<br><br>

               Volunteers sort and store food as it is received, and dispense it to recipients. They also validate 
               recipients' eligibility. Volunteers may also pick up donated food on a regular basis from markets, other donors, 
               and food drives.<br><br>

              Volunteers also help promote food drives and donations through clubs and organizations.<br><br>

              Volunteer drivers are especially needed. We have several pickups from grocery stores during the week. If you
              are willing to be added to the available drivers list, please contact Julianne Sorice (wvfoodpantry@gmail.com).
<!--
              If you want to try sorting and organizing the food, we have an <b>Open Volunteer Day</b>
              every Monday from 10-12 am. Come and help out with whatever is needed at that
              time. You may like it well enough to volunteer on a more frequent basis.

            <p>
              Volunteers who wish to distribute food at the Pantry must complete training.
              Opportunities to train volunteers to distribute food are limited from May through 
              mid-August due to an influx of volunteers over the summer. If you wish to work at the 
              Pantry distributing food, you may have to wait until the fall.

            <h4 style="text-align:center">Supermarket Food Drives</h4>

            <p>
              Help is needed the first Saturday of every month at the Sprouts Farmers Market at 21821 Ventura Blvd
              (at the corner of Ventrua and Topanga Canyon in Woodland Hills). 
              It consists of a two hour shift, 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. 
              Also, we need a scheduler for the Sprouts drive, and a driver to pick up the food 
              and transport it to the Pantry. Interested?<br><br>

              To sign up, contact Jeff Albee or Al Trumpler. If you do
              not have their phone numbers, leave a message at the pantry, (818) 346-5554</p>
